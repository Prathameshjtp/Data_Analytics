# **What is a Data Preprocessing Pipeline?**

Data Preprocessing involves transforming and manipulating raw data to improve its quality, consistency, and relevance for analysis. It encompasses several tasks, including handling missing values, standardizing variables, and removing outliers. By performing these preprocessing steps, data professionals ensure that subsequent analysis is based on reliable and accurate data, leading to better insights and predictions.

A data preprocessing pipeline is a systematic and automated approach that combines multiple preprocessing steps into a cohesive workflow.The pipeline consists of interconnected steps, each of which is responsible for a specific preprocessing task, such as:

- imputing missing values
- scaling numeric features
- finding and removing outliers
- or encoding categorical variables
